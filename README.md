Description:

This task focuses on applying API integration and data visualization skills using Python. The goal is to connect to a real-time public API — in this case, the OpenWeatherMap API — to fetch weather forecast data, process it, and display the insights visually using Python’s popular libraries: Matplotlib and Seaborn. The entire implementation is done in Visual Studio Code (VS Code), a powerful and widely-used code editor.

This task simulates a real-world data workflow — pulling in raw JSON data from an online service and transforming it into a meaningful visualization dashboard for analysis or reporting.

Objective:

Use Python to fetch weather forecast data from the OpenWeatherMap public API.

Parse and process the fetched data to extract useful insights like temperature trends.

Use Seaborn and Matplotlib to visualize this data in an intuitive and informative format.

Deliver the solution in the form of a Python script along with a visual output/dashboard.

Tools and Technologies Used:

1. OpenWeatherMap API:
 
A public API that provides real-time weather data, including current conditions, forecasts, and historical data. For this project, we used the 5-day / 3-hour forecast endpoint.

2. Python Programming:
 
Python was used as the core programming language because of its excellent support for HTTP requests, JSON parsing, and data visualization.

Key Python libraries used:

requests: To make HTTP requests to the API.

json: To parse the JSON data (built into Python).

matplotlib.pyplot: To plot the data.

seaborn: To enhance visual appeal and readability of charts.

3. Visual Studio Code (VS Code):

VS Code was used as the coding environment for this project. It is a lightweight yet powerful editor that supports Python development via extensions. Features such as IntelliSense, integrated terminal, and 

debugging make it ideal for scripting and data tasks.

OUTCOME:


The final outcome of the project was a Python script that could dynamically fetch real-time weather data and produce a visually appealing graph showing temperature forecasts. This task not only helped in 
understanding how to work with APIs and JSON data but also improved skills in data parsing, visualization, and real-world problem-solving using Python. It also reinforced best practices in software development
using VS Code, where features like real-time error checking, code formatting, and extension integrations contributed to a smooth development experience. Overall, this project successfully achieved the deliverableof creating a Python-based script and visualization dashboard, fulfilling all the task requirements effectively.This project solves the problem of transforming complex,raw weather forecast data into an easy-to-understand visual format for better decision-making and analysis. Weather data provided by public APIs like OpenWeatherMap is often returned in JSON format,which can be difficult for non-technical users to interpret. By integrating this API with Python and creating automated visualizations, the project bridges the gap between raw data and human-readable insights. It enables users—such as travelers, city planners,or researchers—to quickly grasp future temperature trends, make informed plans, and detect patterns like heatwaves or cold spells in advance.This solution also demonstrates how real-time data can be 
programmatically accessed and converted into meaningful visual dashboards without manual intervention. In essence, it transforms scattered forecast data into actionable intelligence using technology, coding, and visualization, making it valuable in both personal and professional contexts
